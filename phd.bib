     abstract = {Most analyses of the principal-agent problem assume that the principal chooses an incentive scheme to maximize expected utility subject to the agent's utility being at a stationary point. An important paper of Mirrlees has shown that this approach is generally invalid. We present an alternative procedure. If the agent's preferences over income lotteries are independent of action, we show that the optimal way of implementing an action by the agent can be found by solving a convex programming problem. We use this to characterize the optimal incentive scheme and to analyze the determinants of the seriousness of an incentive problem.},

                  Forestry Initiative that includes a green-up
                  constraint which limits the average clearcut opening
                  to 48ha for 3 years or until the average height of
                  the regenerated trees is $>$1.4m. In addition to
                  constraining the average clearcut size, many

                  between 60 and 90ha. In this research, a heuristic

                  requires the successful integration of economic and
                  ecological goals. To attain such integration, land
                  managers need decision support tools that

                  options to assess resources sustainability at large

                  Management Activities on Timber and Habitat
                  (LEEMATH) is a tool for evaluating alternative

                  LEEMATH emphasizes timber production and wildlife
                  habitat in industrial forest landscapes. LEEMATH
                  provides a framework upon which various models can

                  forest simulation optimization system (FSOS). These
                  concepts include: (1) two common landscape
                  indicators - patch size and age class distributions
                  - to quantify non-timber resource objectives; (2)

                  (4) target-oriented, adaptive forest ecosystem

                  harvest units to achieve a desired forest ecosystem

  abstract =	 {Harvest activities tend often to create landscapes
                  where the old forest is fragmented into isolated
                  patches that provide marginal conditions for species
                  that inhabit forest interiors. This paper presents a
                  long-range planning model designed to maximize the
                  net present value and to create continuous patches
                  of old forest. In this model, the spatial structure
                  of old forest is controlled by core area and edge
                  habitats. Core area is defined as the area of old
                  forest that is free of edge effects from surrounding
                  habitats. The core area requirement is set to a
                  fixed value for each of a number of time periods,
                  whereas the area of edge habitats, which should be
                  as small as possible, is weighted against the net
                  present value. The model is applied in a case study
                  to an actual landscape consisting of 755 stands of
                  forest in northern Sweden and solved using simulated

                  adjacency or spatial considerations of harvesting
                  and road building needed for transportation. These
                  problems have been solved with different
                  approaches. We discuss results obtained with
                  heuristic approaches and exact model formulations},
